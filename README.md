This is a Java (eclipse) project to show a very simple implementation of dynamically loading class into jvm.
It may be useful for programmers who are new to Java's classloader.

The Test class is not so good, so you should do some extra work to see the effect.
1. Run the Test 
2. manually modify the PrintModule.java, for example to let it print "B B B", and then save it. Wait a moment and now you see the difference.
